# MatLab-Skydive-Model

The PDF file assignment2.pdf will display all code and figures calculated in MatLab. Look here for a 
rundown of the entire project.

For this project I compared the modelled data to the real world calculated values for Felix Baumgartnerâ€™s
jump. The real world recorded data can be found the the spreadsheet "RedBullStratosData180". Air resistance,
temperature, humidity, and parachute resistance were considered in the model.
